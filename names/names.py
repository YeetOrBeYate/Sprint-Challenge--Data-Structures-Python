# I ran into this approach from a stackerOverflow thread I found a long time ago during pair programming
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7571635/fastest-way-to-check-if-a-value-exists-in-a-list
#basically everyon there said just asking for x in array was the fastest way to do things. Run time lowered from 6->1 second

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools that allow for a very efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?  Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data
# structures, but you may not import any additional libraries that you did not write yourself.
